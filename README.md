Rate: $20/hr.
Approximately 20 hrs at most.
Show you the middle build this weekend, can finish by 5th Jan 2016.

please provide a Windows command line implementation of the OpenCV pedestrian detection. A GTX 970 graphic card is available to speed things up.

Please document the code. URLs are fine.

Resulting code needs to process these 500MB example images:

Output should be 
- a .csv file with one line of data for each image processed. 
(image path, image name, number of people found, coordinates of rectangles, etc.) 
- copy the source image, and save with rectangles drawn to them to new folder.
- whatever additional data is available and you find helpful.
